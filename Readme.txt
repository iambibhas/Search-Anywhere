Search Anywhere 1.0
====================
It is only in Alpha stage. You can install the extension, add any number of search engines from the options page. 

You have to provide a name of the engine and a pattern. It should be a GET string of the search engine using '%s' in place of the query. e.g. - 
http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&q=%s

But for a glitch, you have to Disable and re-Enable the extension for the new search engines to show up. So you better add all the engines at one go and then re-enable the extension. I'm trying to fix it. and will update you of it once I'm done. :)

Till then, enjoy ..
